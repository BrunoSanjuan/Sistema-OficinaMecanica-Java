# Sistema-OficinaMecanica-Java
This is a real project and is being used by my aunt's mechanic shop to keep track of customer service orders.

She used to use a physical paper notepad, and all the necessary information she requested about the customer is in this system. After filling in the information, the system saves the data in a .txt file with the customer's name in a directory, making it easier to find.
